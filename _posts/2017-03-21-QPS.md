QPS is an "add-on" scheduling algorithm for input-queued crossbar switches. It builds upon "simple" 
Queue-Proportional Sampling, and achieves $O(1)$ time complexity per port. It can boost the performance 
(throughput or delay or both) of a large amount of existing switching scheduling algorithms (_e.g._, iSLIP, SERENA).
