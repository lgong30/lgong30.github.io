ForestStream is a novel measurement algorithm suite which combined streaming algorithm techniques and graph sampling techniques. 
Unlike traditional graph sampling techniques, ForestStream can unbiasedly sampling certain portion of trees from a graph forest, thus is able to achieve much higher accuracy than traditional graph sampling techniques.
