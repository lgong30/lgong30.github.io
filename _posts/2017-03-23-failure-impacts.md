In this project, we developed a tool which can help detect failures in a virtualized environment. 
Besides detecting failures, it could also provide useful information regarding, for
example, whether certain resiliency policy worked as it was desired to. 
Thus, it can help the corresponding engineer
to better prioritize their time (for example, after some failure, the
resiliency policy worked perfectly (_i.e._, no impact), then the corresponding engineer
might not need to fix the bugs that caused the failure immediately, 
if he/she happened to have other tasks at hand.)
