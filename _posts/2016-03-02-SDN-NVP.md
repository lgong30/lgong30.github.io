SD-EONVP is a network virtualization platform that provides efficient 
interfaces for customers to create and manage their virtual networks 
whose underlying infrastructure is the flexible-grid [elastic optical networks](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319301730). 
It extends the open-source project OpenVirteX (OVX) in the following 
three aspects: 1) it supports quantitative bandwidth allocation (
of course only for elastic optical networks) by providing spectral 
resource virtualization to OVX; 2) it provides high efficient built-in 
[virtual network embedding algorithms](http://www.zuqingzhu.info/pub_doc/2014/06679238.pdf); 3) it provides convenient interfaces based on web GUI 
for customers to create and manage their virtual network. 


System Overview
===============

![ ](http://xlong88.github.io/attachments/arch.png)

The above figure shows the overview of our network virtualization system. From it, we can see there are three major modules in our system.

* Virtual Software-Defined Virtual Network Management Module
    
    > A Web GUI for users (or customers) to create and manage their virtual networks continently. 
    
    > Implementation  
        Front-end: [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)  
        Back-end: [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    
    > More details you can refer to the video demo in the following part and [my master thesis](http://xlong88.github.io/attachments/master_thesis.pdf)
 
* Network Hypervisor (Extended [OpenVirteX](http://ovx.onlab.us/), E-OVX for short)

    > A openflow-based network hyper-visor supporting for network virtualization
    
    > It is based on [OpenVirteX](http://ovx.onlab.us/), we did protocol extension on it (i.e., making it support quantitative bandwidth allocation for elastic optical network based on the concept of spectral 
    virtualization)
    
    > More details you can refer to the official web of [OpenVirteX](http://ovx.onlab.us/)
    
* Virtual Network Embedder 

    > The module is to conduct virtual network embedding, which is one of the major challenges in network virtualization. In the platform, we have built in some efficient virtual network embedding algorithms.
    
    > Motivations to separating it from Network Hyper-visor  
        Easily upgrade  
        Easily debug
        

### Major Principle 

* Topology Virtualization

    > Based upon LLDP, creating an "illusion" (for the controller of the virtual network) that the topology of the virtual network is the same as what the customer wanted

* Address Virtualization and Spectral Virtualization

    > based on OpenFlow, rewriting the addresses and spectral information at the ingress and egress switches to make the controller of the virtual network believe that it "owns" the whole network

More details, you can refer to [OpenVirteX official web](http://ovx.onlab.us/) or [my master thesis](http://xlong88.github.io/attachments/master_thesis.pdf)


### A Video Demo 

The following video shows how a user applies our network virtualization platform to create and manage their virtual networks.

Model details your can refer to my [defense ppt](http://xlong88.github.io/attachments/defense_ppt.pptx) and the system part of [my master thesis](http://xlong88.github.io/attachments/master_thesis.pdf).


### Known Issues

* Robustness: current version is known to be not very robust

* Speed: the response time (especially for starting a virtual network) is 
quite long, as the current VNE module is implemented in MATLAB


### Applications
